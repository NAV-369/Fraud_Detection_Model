# Task 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing for Ethiopian-Based Telegram E-Commerce Channels

## Overview
In this task, we are focusing on ingesting and preprocessing message data from Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis by normalizing, cleaning, and structuring the text, especially handling Amharic linguistic features.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Identify Relevant Channels
- Identify at least 5 relevant Ethiopian-based Telegram channels related to e-commerce.
- Channels must contain messages related to products, services, prices, and locations.

### 2. Data Ingestion System
- Implement a system to ingest messages from the selected Telegram channels.
- The system should extract raw messages, along with any associated metadata like timestamps, sender details, and other relevant information.

### 3. Text Preprocessing
- Tokenize the Amharic text data to break it into words or meaningful chunks.
- Normalize the text, handling special characters, punctuation, and case normalization.
- Handle Amharic linguistic features such as morphology, inflection, and syntax.

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Remove irrelevant or redundant information from the messages (e.g., advertisements, links, or emojis).
- Filter out noise that does not contribute to the analysis of product-related content.

### 5. Data Structuring
- Structure the preprocessed data in a format suitable for further analysis.
- Organize the data into categories such as product names, prices, locations, and other relevant entities.

### 6. Data Storage
- Store the preprocessed data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database) for easy access and further analysis.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python libraries such as `pandas`, `nltk`, and `spacy` for text processing and data handling.
- Telegram API for data extraction.
- Custom preprocessing functions to handle Amharic text.

## Expected Output
The final output will be a clean, structured dataset containing relevant product-related information from the Telegram channels. This dataset will serve as the foundation for subsequent tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and further analysis.

## Future Work
- Model Building , Training and Evaluation as part of Task 2.
- Implementing additional data cleaning or feature extraction based on the analysis requirements.
